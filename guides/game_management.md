## Creating a Game

Once you've signed in, you should be redirect to a page that looks something like the one below.

This is the games page. This is where you can see all your current games that are running on Stardust.

![Game's Page](https://github.com/Stardust-Platform/Documentation/blob/main/images/guides/game_management/Games_Page.png "Game's Page")

Go ahead and hit that "+ Add Game" button to go ahead and lay the foundation for our first game. On click, a form fill should pop up asking you to fill out the information about your game.

The form will ask you for a name for your game, a description, a game Icon, and which blockchain you'd like to deploy on.

> ðŸ“˜ Use a Game Icon
> 
> While you don't have to upload a game Icon to create a game on Stardust it definitely helps! Your game icon will be displayed on the left navigation bar to let you know which game you have set as the active game. Being able to see that icon will help to let you know for sure you're looking at the right game and making the correct edits!


Once you've selected the blockchain that you'd like to build on then go ahead and hit that "Confirm" button.

The dashboard should set the newly created game as the default, but if not, hit the "Select" button to make sure that it is the active game.

And just like that! You've created your first game on the blockchain! No gas fees, and no coding required! Let's move on to the next step of getting your API key!

## Getting Your API Key

To start, shift your attention to the navigation bar on the left hand side of the page. Near the bottom of the navigation options there is "API Keys." Go ahead and navigate there.

Now you're on the API page. This is where you can see how many API calls are being made(top tile), view the API logs(bottom right), and manage your API keys(bottom left).

Go ahead and shift your attention to the key management page and click on "Create Key"

With that done you've now successfully created your API key to use, and you're ready to begin using the Stardust API.

Make sure to take note of your API key as you'll need it in the next steps of this guide!

> ðŸ“˜ Viewing API Calls and Logs
> 
> By default the number of calls and logs are associated with each API key. Unless a key is selected as active, the default will display zero API calls, and no logs. To view the number of api calls and the logs, select a key from the key management tile.
